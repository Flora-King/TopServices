### Bugs and Errors

#### Solved
* I encountered a few errors in HTML and CSS during the build phase. For example, I had created a button inside the anchor tag. After seeing the error from the validation report, i adjusted my code.

* I encountered issues while building the services section layout. The service types were displaying as "two columns side-by-side and two rows" structure that I needed. I solved this by created an outer container to house all service types plus a container for each service type

#### Unsolved

* My accessibility report shows a low perfomance report. This is due to the many font awesome icons i have used in this website.
